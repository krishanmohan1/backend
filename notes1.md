Great question, Krishan! 🌟 You're noticing some flags in `npm` commands like `--save` and `--save-dev`. Let’s break them down in **very simple terms**.

---

## 🔍 `npm install express --save` — What does `--save` do?

### ✅ Simple Answer:

It tells `npm` to **add the package to your `dependencies`** in `package.json`.

So when someone else installs your project using `npm install`, they will also get **Express** automatically.

---

### 📦 What is `dependencies`?

In your `package.json` file, there's a section like this:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}
```

That means your **project needs Express to run**.

---

## ❌ Do I need `--save` today?

> **No. Not anymore!**

Since **npm v5 (2017)**, `--save` is the **default behavior**.

So now you can just write:

```bash
npm install express
```

And Express will automatically go to the `dependencies` section.

---

## 💻 What about `--save-dev`?

### ✅ Use `--save-dev` when:

You are installing **developer tools** — tools that are **only needed during development**, not when your app runs in production.

---

### 📂 It goes in `devDependencies`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "nodemon": "^2.0.7"
}
```

### ⚙️ Examples:

| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install express`            | Add Express to `dependencies`                |
| `npm install nodemon --save-dev` | Add nodemon to `devDependencies`             |
| `npm install jest --save-dev`    | Add Jest (testing tool) to `devDependencies` |

## 📦 Summary Table:

| Flag               | Used For                                  | Goes Into                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `--save`           | Runtime libraries like Express            | `dependencies`            |
| `--save-dev`       | Dev-time tools like nodemon, eslint, jest | `devDependencies`         |
| *(No flag needed)* | Since npm v5+, `--save` is default        | `dependencies` by default |
