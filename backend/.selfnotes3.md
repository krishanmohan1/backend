how to add email formate validator and password validator 
---

## ✅ 1. Install `validator` (for reliable email validation)

```bash
npm install validator
```

---

## ✅ 2. Update your code

```js
const validator = require('validator'); // at top of your file
const registerUser = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const { email, username, fullName, password } = req.body;

  console.log("email : ", email);

  // Check for empty fields
  if ([fullName, email, username, password].some((field) => field?.trim() === "")) {
    throw new ApiError(400, "All fields are compulsory");
  }

  // ✅ Email format validation
  if (!validator.isEmail(email)) {
    throw new ApiError(400, "Invalid email format");
  }

  // ✅ Password strength validation
  const strongPasswordRegex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[\W_]).{8,}$/;

  if (!strongPasswordRegex.test(password)) {
    throw new ApiError(400, "Password must be at least 8 characters and include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character");
  }

  // Continue your logic: check if user exists, upload avatar, etc.
});
```

## 🧪 Explanation

### ✅ `validator.isEmail(email)`

* Validates if the string is in correct email format.
* Handles edge cases that regex often misses.

### ✅ `strongPasswordRegex`

This regex ensures:

* `(?=.*[a-z])` – at least one lowercase letter
* `(?=.*[A-Z])` – at least one uppercase letter
* `(?=.*\d)` – at least one digit
* `(?=.*[\W_])` – at least one special character
* `. {8,}` – minimum 8 characters

---

## ✅ Optional: Cleaner Helper Function (Bonus)

You can also extract validations into a utility function to keep your controller clean:

```js
const isStrongPassword = (password) => {
  const regex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[\W_]).{8,}$/;
  return regex.test(password);
};
```

Then in your code:

```js
if (!isStrongPassword(password)) {
  throw new ApiError(400, "Password must be at least 8 characters and include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character");
}
```

# Regex Syntax and concept 
Absolutely! You're looking at a **regular expression (regex)** — a powerful tool used to define patterns for **searching, validating, or manipulating strings** like passwords, emails, etc.

Let’s break down your regex **step-by-step** so it becomes easy to understand:

---

### ✅ The full regex:

```js
const strongPasswordRegex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[\W_]).{8,}$/;
```

This is used to validate that a password is:

* At least 8 characters
* Has **1 lowercase letter**
* Has **1 uppercase letter**
* Has **1 digit (number)**
* Has **1 special character**

---

## 🧠 Understanding Each Part:

### `/.../`

→ This is the **regex literal** syntax in JavaScript.

---

### `^`

→ Asserts the **start of the string**. It means the pattern should match from the beginning.

---

### `(?=...)`

→ This is called a **positive lookahead**.

It checks if something **exists ahead** in the string **without consuming** characters.

---

### 1. `(?=.*[a-z])`

* ✅ Check if **at least one lowercase letter** (`a` to `z`) exists anywhere in the string.

**Example match:** `password` ✅
**No match:** `PASSWORD123!` ❌

---

### 2. `(?=.*[A-Z])`

* ✅ Check if **at least one uppercase letter** (`A` to `Z`) exists.

**Example match:** `PassWord` ✅
**No match:** `password` ❌

---

### 3. `(?=.*\d)`

* ✅ Check if **at least one digit** (`0-9`) exists.
* `\d` is shorthand for `[0-9]`.

**Example match:** `Pass1word!` ✅
**No match:** `Password!` ❌

---

### 4. `(?=.*[\W_])`

* ✅ Check if **at least one special character** exists:

  * `\W` = "non-word characters" (like `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.)
  * `_` is added because `\W` doesn't include underscore

**Example match:** `Pass@123` ✅
**No match:** `Password1` ❌

---

### 5. `.{8,}`

* ✅ Ensure the total string length is **at least 8 characters**
* `.` = any character
* `{8,}` = minimum 8 characters

---

### `$`

→ Asserts the **end of the string**.

---

## ✅ Putting It All Together:

This pattern says:

> Start of string → must have 1 lowercase → 1 uppercase → 1 digit → 1 special char → and be at least 8 characters → end of string.

---

## 🔁 Example Valid Passwords:

* `Abcdef1!` ✅
* `Strong_Pass9$` ✅

## ❌ Invalid Examples:

* `abcdefg` ❌ (no uppercase, no number, no special char)
* `ABC12345` ❌ (no lowercase, no special char)
* `Abc1` ❌ (too short)
